# Bank Project

Shafan: 
1. The purpose of this project was to teach us how multifile projects work, along with how to work with other people on one repo, using branches and updating those branches to the main branch so we know how to collaborate for future reference, like in a professional setting for example.
2. So for my portion, bank.py, I was a little confused at first as I had forgotten about local hidden functions. I realized that the database that each class would have should not be filled upon creation, as it will be populated by entries from the functions in user.py! After having that understanding, the rest of the logic was somewhat easy as we had learnt how to do it most of what it reuqired previously in this class, and I have knowledge of coding in general.
3. Other people could use my reposoitory as their own bank system, though its very basic and doesn't include a user interface, by fork and cloning it to make their own additions and updates.

Detail the purpose of the project
The entire purpose of this project that was made, was to make code for a simple bank system that manages user accounts in a secure way. This was done by using private methods to protect sensitive data so that it canâ€™t be accessed, and the data remains confidential within the bank's internal system. The project also shows collaboration between two developers.
Detail the thought process of your solution
The thought process of the solution was first to create a secure and maintainable banking system. First, there is the Bank class and the User class, which we each worked on. For example, the Bank class is designed to handle all sensitive data using private attributes and methods to keep private information. In addition, the User class acts as a user interface to the bank, like checking balances while keeping it secure with the bank. This also uses private methods to keep confidentiality. The collaboration and teamwork were shown with the use of branches as well.
Detail how others could use your repository
Others could use our repository as a starting area/point to help them make more complex banking applications and secure user management. Overall, this project shows how to securely handle private data. People can use this to also show how to use secure method designs. Additionally, it also shows a good idea of a workflow template for teamwork in software development using GitHub.
